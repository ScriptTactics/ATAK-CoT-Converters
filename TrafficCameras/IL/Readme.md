# Illinois KML

Illinois feed can only be imported as a .kml since the images are static and only refresh once every 5-10 minutes.

Run the image_feed.py script to modify the Illinois_Gateway_Traffic_Cameras.kml in the directory to get a modified .kml file.

Or just import the Illinois_Gateway_Traffic_Cameras_new.kml into ATAK directory to get the cameras. I have not been able to find any way to group the .kml into different regions so its all or nothing at this time.
